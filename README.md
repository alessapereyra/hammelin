# Integration Exercise: Java Library Wrapper

# Hammelin 

JFugue (http://www.jfugue.org/index.html) is a Java library that let's developers program a melody through using the basic notes, chords, etc. The music can be saved to a MIDI file, or played just then. 

Hammelin wraps around JFugue functionality to let JRuby users create, play and save MIDIs file using Ruby syntax and some sugar with that. 

# Using Hammelin

Hammelin gaves you easiness of play. Right now, you can use a MusicString 
to play your own music: 

    Hammelin.play("E5s A5s C6s B5s E5s B5s D6s C6i E6i G#5i E6i | A5s E5s A5s C6s B5s E5s B5s D6s C6i A5i Ri")

You could also work with notes: 

    note = Hammelin::Note.new("E5s")

And then just play it

    note.play

Hammelin also allows you to play with ranges:

    note = Hammelin::Note.new("C")
    note.upto("E5s").play

If wanted, you also have access to each note of the range:

    note.upto("E5s").each do {|note| note.play }
    note.upto("E5s").each do {|note| note.higher_octaves }


Now go and make some interesting tunes :)

    note = Hammelin::Note.new("C")
    2.times do 
      note.upto("B").play.reverse.play.higher_octaves.play
    end

You could also save your work through a block:

    Hammelin.save_tune("file.mid") do

      note = Hammelin::Note.new("C")
      2.times do 
        note.upto("D#").play.reverse.play.higher_octaves.play.higher_octaves.play.higher_octaves.play
      end

    end


### Running on GNU/Linux? 

There was a reported bug when a missing library wasn't found by the Java VM. The file (libpuse-java.so) should be on 

    /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386
